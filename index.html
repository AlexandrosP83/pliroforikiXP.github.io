<h1>Privacy Policy — Πληροφορικη XP</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 27, 2026</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, who can see it, and what choices you have when you use the Πληροφορικη XP mobile application (the “App”).</p>

<h2>1) Controller and contact</h2>
<p>The App is operated by the developer (“we”, “us”).</p>
<p><strong>Contact email:</strong> <a href="mailto:politisalexan@gmail.com">politisalexan@gmail.com</a></p>

<h2>2) What data we collect</h2>
<p>When you sign in and use the App, we process the following categories of data:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Account identifiers:</strong> your Firebase Authentication user ID (<code>uid</code>) and your Google account email address used for sign-in.</li>
  <li><strong>Profile/leaderboard data:</strong> a <code>username</code> derived from your email (for example, without “@gmail.com”).</li>
  <li><strong>Learning/progress data:</strong> XP/level, selected avatar (chosen from preset icons), unlocked achievements, and statistics such as counts of completed exercises by type and difficulty (e.g., multiple-choice completed, fill-in-the-blanks completed, easy/medium/hard completed), plus last-updated timestamps.</li>
  <li><strong>Bug report content (if you send one):</strong> the details you submit in a bug report form and (optionally) an exercise identifier.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3) Leaderboard visibility (important)</h2>
<p>The App includes a leaderboard visible to <strong>signed-in users</strong>.</p>
<p>Because of how the App is currently implemented, other signed-in users may be able to view your leaderboard/profile information (such as username, XP/level, avatar, achievements and completion stats). In the current version, your account email address may also be accessible to other signed-in users.</p>
<p>If you do not want this visibility, please contact us and we will delete your account data on request (see Section 9).</p>

<h2>4) Why we use your data</h2>
<p>We use your information to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Provide sign-in and maintain your account.</li>
  <li>Save and sync your learning progress across devices.</li>
  <li>Display leaderboard information to signed-in users.</li>
  <li>Respond to support requests and bug reports.</li>
  <li>Maintain the security and integrity of the App.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5) Legal bases (EEA/EU users)</h2>
<p>If you are in the EEA/EU, we process your personal data primarily because it is necessary to provide the App you request (e.g., sign-in, saving progress, and providing the leaderboard features) (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)).</p>
<p>Where appropriate, we may also process certain data for our legitimate interests (e.g., keeping the App secure and fixing bugs) (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)).</p>

<h2>6) Service providers (Firebase / Google)</h2>
<p>We use Google Firebase (including Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore) to provide login and cloud storage for your account and progress data.</p>
<p>Google processes some data on our behalf under Firebase’s Data Processing and Security Terms. You can learn more here:
  <a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms/data-processing-terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://firebase.google.com/terms/data-processing-terms</a>
</p>

<h2>7) Data retention</h2>
<p>We keep your account and progress data while your account is active and as needed to provide the App.</p>
<p>If you request deletion, we will delete (or anonymize where feasible) your account and associated progress data within a reasonable time, unless we must keep certain information to comply with legal obligations or to protect the App against abuse.</p>

<h2>8) International transfers</h2>
<p>Because we use Firebase, your data may be processed on servers located outside your country, including outside the EEA. When applicable, transfers are protected using appropriate safeguards provided by Firebase/Google under their terms.</p>

<h2>9) Your rights and how to request deletion</h2>
<p>You can contact us to request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data.</p>
<p><strong>The App does not currently support in-app account deletion.</strong> To request deletion, email
  <a href="mailto:politisalexan@gmail.com">politisalexan@gmail.com</a>
  from the Google account you used to sign in and include your in-app username and any details that help us locate your account.
</p>
<p>For EEA/EU users, you also have rights such as restriction of processing, objection, and data portability, and the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.</p>

<h2>10) Children</h2>
<p>The App is intended for a general audience (including students). If a parent/guardian believes a child has provided personal data, they can contact us to request access or deletion.</p>

<h2>11) Security</h2>
<p>We take reasonable measures to protect data, but no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.</p>

<h2>12) Changes to this policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version on this page and update the “Last updated” date.</p>

<h2>13) Contact</h2>
<p>If you have questions or requests regarding privacy, contact us at:
